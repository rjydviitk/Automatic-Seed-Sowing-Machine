# Automatic-Seed-Sowing-Machine
Objective: 
• Manufacture seed sowing machine that senses atmospheric conditions and performs soil digging, seed planting and covering
Approach:
• Designed using CAD software (Fusion 360, Inventor) and manufactured precisely using lathes, milling, and 3D printers 
• Implemented the DHT-11 sensor for collecting and analysing real-time atmospheric temperature and humidity data 
• Automated 9V DC water pump and adjusted 12V DC motor speed using Arduino UNO based on collected data
Outcome:
• Successfully developed a fully functional seed sowing machine that automates based on real-time environmental data
